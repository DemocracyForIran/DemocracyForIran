#  Draft of an Iranian constitution for transition

## TODO
The link we have is in (Stanford Searchworks)[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13772774].

We need to either:
- Find a textual source and copy it here
- Or type in (or OCR) the images and copy here.

We need to be aware of copyright claims, for instance the Stanford source is copyrighted and if we don't find a better source we should make sure we conform.
